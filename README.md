<p>Develop a stack of objects of the "number in different number systems" type. Develop a calculator program where the user can enter numbers in one of four number systems: binary, octal, hexadecimal, decimal. Numbers entered by the user are pushed onto the stack until the user enters one of the 4 simplest algebraic operations. The operation is applied to all numbers on the stack, and its result is placed on top. To get the final result, the user types =. An example of working with the program:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>25</em><br /><em>031</em><br /><em>0x19</em><br /><em>0b11001</em><br /><em>+ // after entering this character, the sum of all the previous ones will be calculated and put on the stack. result: 100</em><br /><em>100</em><br /><em>- // after entering this character, the difference between the last element of the stack and the sum of all previous ones will be calculated. result: 0</em><br /><em>= // 0</em><em></em></p>
<p><em></em></p>
